This work was supported by Cancer Research UK RadNet Cambridge [C17918/A28870].

Tools include:
- [Image](doc/image.md): load, plot, and compare medical images from DICOM, Nifti, or NumPy arrays.
- [ROI and RtStruct](doc/structures.md): load, plot and compare regions of interest (ROIs) and structure sets.
- [Patient](doc/patient.md): load file tree containing multiple images and structure sets for a single patient.
- [Synthetic images](doc/synthetic_images.md): create image data containing simple geometric shapes and ROIs.
